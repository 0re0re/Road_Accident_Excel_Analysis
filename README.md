# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

This project is a full Excel-based analytics solution analyzing **417,883 road accidents** using data from the UK Road Safety database.  
It was one of my earliest analytics projects and showcases my ability to clean data, model trends, and design dashboards using Excel.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to use Excel to perform:

- Data cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Year-on-year comparison  
- KPI creation  
- Dashboard design for executive reporting  

The final dashboard summarizes accident severity, vehicle involvement, road conditions, and monthly trends.

## 🧠 Key Insights

### **1️⃣ Casualty Severity Distribution**
- Slight casualties accounted for **87%** of total cases.  
- Serious injuries represented **~12%**.  
- Fatalities were **0.5%**, totaling **2,319 cases**.

### **2️⃣ Vehicles Most Involved**
- Cars accounted for **79.8%** of all casualties (333,485).  
- Motorcycles, buses, vans, and bicycles contributed much lower percentages.
